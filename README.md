<h3>Welcome to a modern GNOME look<br></h3>

The all-new HyperFluent theme builds on the sleek design language of Adwaita, combining blurred panels and window elements to create a modern, frosted glass design that is both legible and beautiful.
<br>

<h3>Adapts to you<br></h3>

With blur and transparent elements dominating the design, your wallpaper dynamically changes the whole look of your windows and UI elements. The result is a harmonious relationship between your desktop and core user interfaces that looks stunning.
<br>

<h3>Beyond the interface</h3>

Not only do your windows and UI elements take on a beautiful new design - your icons, sounds, fonts, and even cursors - are completely transformed into a gorgeous blend of individually designed components coming together to form one unified theme.

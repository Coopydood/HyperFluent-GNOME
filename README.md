### Welcome to a modern GNOME look

The all-new HyperFluent theme builds on the sleek design language of **Adwaita**, combining blurred panels and window elements to create a modern, frosted glass design that is both legible _and_ beautiful.
<br>

### Adapts to you

With blur and transparency at the core of the design, your wallpaper **dynamically** changes the whole look of your windows and UI elements. The result is a harmonious relationship between your **desktop and core user interfaces** that looks stunning.
<br>

### Beyond the interface

Not only do your windows and UI elements take on a beautiful new design - **your icons, sounds, fonts, and even cursors** - are completely transformed into one gorgeous unified theme.
